        "* **Online predictions** are synchronous requests that are made to the endpoint deployed from Model Garden and are served with low latency. Online predictions are useful if the embeddings are being used in production. The cost for online prediction is based on the time a virtual machine spends waiting in an active state (an endpoint with a deployed model) to handle prediction requests.\n",

Batch predictions are useful if you want to generate embeddings for a large number of X-rays or text queries for use in training and don't require low latency.
